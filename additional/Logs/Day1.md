# Day 1
Since the task was given to me at around 3pm, and that my half day shift started at 3pm, I only seriously started on the assessment at around 8pm. 
The Task focuses on 3 main points: 
<li> Design the pages, components, routes and their relations</li>
<li> Culture myself about the asked technologies and what can be added to improve the project without loosing a lot of  time</li>
<li> Implementing the actual solution </li>

<br>

### Planning:
Regarding my current knowledge and lack of profound knowledge about React (Even though I worked with NextJs), my first task was focused on revisiting react by revisiting old projects. <br> Moreover, I also made some researches about new technologies and to decide what improvements and plugins I could come with. <br> <br>
After going through multiple sources, I installed react using github's typescript template and then added vite to improve bundling and building time. Moreover, I started coding basic components and pages that might be needed later.

The basic architecture for the project has been decided and it's time I start the design. <br>
Since it got late I decided to leave this for tomorrow
