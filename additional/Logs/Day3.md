# Day 3
Analyzing your work makes you reconsider your choices and paths. So the first thing that I did was deleting the paths extension since it seemed pretty useless so far and more of a distraction than a useful extension.  
Furthermore, since I moved to the main component, I needed some mocked data that I was going to use in a static way to test my components. So I did a small query using Github GraphQL API Explorer and paste it in a JSON File.  
I also moved Header, Footer and Main Page elements to get a better overview of the files and the overall architecture.  
After another hour of work, I gave more structure to the project and finished the main components (Main search bar & list styles only)  
Since I'm lacking time today due to other responsibilities & my time schedule is freer now on, I'll do the major work on the next 2 days.
