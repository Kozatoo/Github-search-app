# Day 2
With the main ideas fixed, I started working on the design with figma, an easy to learn & use designing tool that I already used in my previous working experience.
  
    
I might have used figma as a developer to see the designer's requested result, but I never used it do design by myself.   

After 2 hours, I finally reached an acceptable [ prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/nTLzlmWmXdVgRHr3MqozcB/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=bNlacR6objthZRIY-1)    
  
Later, I started working with storybook to familiarize myself with it by following their docs & tutorial.
I then started working on the header by implementing a user search bar (an additional functionality I added myself and that may be used later on) I decided to add styled-components for easier css integrations. I may change it later but it's learning a an easy & useful tool in the way might be good

## More planning 
After finishing the header and mainly the user search bar, I've decided to plan my next steps following this order:
1. Build the main app interface / the *MVP*
2. Adding the main optional routes *(like redirecting to error page when inserting the wrong url...)* 
3. Integrate the app in **StoryBook**
4. Start writing tests about the actual components
5. Start fetching real data from github (We'll see if it's with the graphQL or rest APi regarding the advancement) 
6. Dockerize the project 
7. Writing the CI/CD Pipeline & integrate it with heroku or netlify
8. Continue the planned next features (adding get users & list their repositories )
