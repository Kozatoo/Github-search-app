# Day 2
With the main ideas fixed, I started working on the design with figma, an easy to learn & use designing tool that I already used in my previous working experience.
<br> <br>
I might have used figma as a developer to see the designer's requested result, but I never used it do design by myself. <br>

After 2 hours, I finally reached an acceptable [ prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/nTLzlmWmXdVgRHr3MqozcB/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=bNlacR6objthZRIY-1)
<br>
Later, I started working with storybook to familiarize myself with it by following their docs & tutorial.
I then started working on the header by implementing a user search bar (an additional functionality I added myself and that may be used later on) I decided to add styled-components for easier css integrations. I may change it later but it's learning a an easy & useful tool in the way might be good
