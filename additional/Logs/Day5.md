# Day 5
This is the final day for the assessment. Since I had some problems with fetching data from github, I lost a lot of time to make it work.  
Finally, after some struggle, I reached a point where the query was correctly fetching the data and the data correctly displayed on the website. But since time is lacking, I had to skips the planned steps and jumped directly to deploying the application on Netlify.   
The deployment was easy, but after deploying, I started to look for refinements and small details that I could add to improve the website.  
I added the github logo and the restructured the code for a better reusability of the components.
